This is a working branch of python-scribd from http://code.google.com/p/python-scribd/

It adds support for progress indication and progressive file reading ports the
code to python3. The code will no longer run on python2.

The changes in this repository have been sent upstream to the issue tracker.

Port to python3:
   http://code.google.com/p/python-scribd/issues/detail?id=6

Python2-compatible changes:
   http://code.google.com/p/python-scribd/issues/detail?id=4
   http://code.google.com/p/python-scribd/issues/detail?id=5

so you shouldn't need to use this working branch once Scribd merge the changes.
